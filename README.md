# GameDevToolsAssignment
Hello! I am EggChamp and here are some tools for game development that I think are good:
1. Godot is good for beginning to code,
2. Unity is pretty good engine once you have started to code,
3. Unreal is great at being fast but requires advanced knowledge.
4. SFML is an annoying library but works perfectly fine for C++ graphics
5. Monogame I used for a little bit after the unity panic since it used C# but there are other frameworks too
6. Game Maker Studio engine is pretty good, I used it for a bit
7. RPG maker is very easy to use but is good if you just want to make a basic rpg
I haven't used any of these last 3:
8. open 3d engine has C++ support and runs in 3d!
9. cocos2d-x is a lightweight 2d engine that has good cross platform support.
10. Phaser is a beginner friendly engine for javascript.
